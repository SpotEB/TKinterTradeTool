A project I worked on while buying and selling a lot of low value skins, meant for traders to easily be able to work out market value and list skins across marketplaces easily.

requires Dmarket and CSFloat API keys in file keys.py in the format below:
```
secret_key_dm = "[KEY]"
public_key_dm = "[KEY]"

secret_csf = "[KEY]"
user_id_csf = "[USER_ID]"
